                        <p class="card-text">Daniel Defoe (1659/1661-1731) was an influential English writer, journalist
                            and spy, known for his novel "Robinson Crusoe" (1719), which helped establish the novel as a
                            literary genre in Britain. He wrote more than 500 works, including novels, pamphlets and
                            magazines on various topics such as politics, crime and religion. Defoe was born in London
                            to Presbyterian dissenters and witnessed major events such as the Great Fire of London,
                            which shaped his interest in catastrophes.

                            Initially a merchant and trader, he faced financial difficulties and turned to writing to
                            earn money. His early works include the poem "The True-Born Englishman" and the satirical
                            pamphlet "The Shortest Way with Dissenters," which landed him in prison.

                            Defoe's fiction was often based on real life, combining journalism with storytelling. His
                            simple and direct writing style appealed to the middle class and set a new standard in
                            English literature. Defoe died in 1731, leaving a lasting legacy in the literary world.
                            a success, making him a pioneer of the modern novel.</p>
                        <p class="card-text">Before turning to writing, he had a varied career in trade and business,
                            which provided him with rich experiences for his literary works.

                            Professional Experience: Defoe worked in trade with Europe, exposing him to diverse cultures
                            and adventures, reflected in "Robinson Crusoe." His work as a journalist honed his detailed
                            and factual narrative style.

                            Literary Contributions: Considered a pioneer of the English novel, Defoe used a realistic
                            approach in his writing. His career included numerous novels and pamphlets on social,
                            economic, and political issues.

                            Relevance to "Robinson Crusoe":

                            Trade and Adventure: Defoe's commercial and adventurous experiences are mirrored in Crusoe's
                            travels and ventures.

                            Religious and Moral Themes: Defoe's Puritan background influences the themes of repentance
                            and spiritual growth in the novel.</p>
